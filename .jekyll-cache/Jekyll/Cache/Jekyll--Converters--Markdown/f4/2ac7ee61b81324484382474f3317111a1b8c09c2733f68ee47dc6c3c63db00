I"<p>Cerebro wishes to be a group for students to be able to collaborate with other students for research purposes mainly in Indian universities. We hope by doing so we see a lot more independent research projects and ideas coming up from students themselves rather than under academics thus leading to a research society which treats students and professors alike.</p>

<p>We also think that through Cerebro we can help foster bright minds into developing solutions for problems in India through AI and research without having to rely on other companies per se.</p>

<p>Our motivation for this has beeing the ample amount of research ideas and talent which we can see in Indian ideas however on the counter very few companies, or very few roles which dwell into these.</p>
